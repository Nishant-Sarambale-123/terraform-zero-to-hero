Here's a **detailed explanation** of the most important **Terraform CLI commands**, along with **interview questions and answers** to help you prepare effectively.

## 🌟 Terraform CLI Commands – Detailed Notes

---

### 1. **`terraform init`**

#### 📌 Description:

Initializes a Terraform working directory containing configuration files.

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Downloads the required provider plugins.
* Initializes the backend if configured.
* Sets up the `.terraform` directory.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
terraform init
```

#### 📘 Notes:

* Must be run before any other Terraform commands.
* Safe to run multiple times – it's idempotent.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
terraform init
```

---

### 2. **`terraform plan`**

#### 📌 Description:

Generates an execution plan showing what Terraform will do before making any changes.

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Compares current state with desired state in `.tf` files.
* Shows what actions (add/change/delete) Terraform will take.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
terraform plan
```

#### 📘 Notes:

* Helps catch potential issues before applying changes.
* Doesn’t change infrastructure, only shows the plan.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan.out
```

---

### 3. **`terraform apply`**

#### 📌 Description:

Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Executes the plan and modifies infrastructure accordingly.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
terraform apply
```

#### 📘 Notes:

* Can take a saved plan file from `terraform plan -out=...`.
* Prompts for approval unless `-auto-approve` is used.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
terraform apply
# or non-interactive:
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

### 4. **`terraform destroy`**

#### 📌 Description:

Removes all Terraform-managed infrastructure.

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Destroys all resources defined in the `.tf` files.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

#### 📘 Notes:

* Used for cleanup and avoiding unnecessary billing.
* Use with caution!

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

---

### 5. **`terraform validate`**

#### 📌 Description:

Validates whether the configuration is syntactically valid.

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Checks for syntax errors in `.tf` files.
* Does not check resource availability or credentials.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
terraform validate
```

#### 📘 Notes:

* Run before `plan` to ensure configuration is valid.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
terraform validate
```

---

### 6. **`terraform fmt`**

#### 📌 Description:

Formats Terraform configuration files to a canonical style.

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Reformats `.tf` files for readability and consistency.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
terraform fmt
```

#### 📘 Notes:

* Automatically aligns indentation and spacing.
* Non-destructive.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
terraform fmt -recursive
```

## 🧠 Terraform CLI – Interview Questions

---

### Q1: **What does `terraform init` do and why is it important?**

**Answer:**
`terraform init` initializes the working directory, downloads provider plugins, and sets up the backend. It's the first command you must run before using any other Terraform commands.

---

### Q2: **How does `terraform plan` help in infrastructure management?**

**Answer:**
It shows what changes Terraform will make without applying them. This helps detect errors early and review changes before execution.

---

### Q3: **What is the difference between `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`?**

**Answer:**

* `plan` previews changes without applying them.
* `apply` actually provisions or changes the infrastructure.

---

### Q4: **When would you use `terraform destroy`?**

**Answer:**
To clean up resources no longer needed, especially in testing or demo environments. Helps avoid unnecessary cloud costs.

---

### Q5: **How can you validate the syntax of your Terraform configuration files?**

**Answer:**
Using the command:

```bash
terraform validate
```

It checks for syntax errors but does not interact with cloud providers.

---

### Q6: **Why should you use `terraform fmt` regularly?**

**Answer:**
It enforces a consistent formatting style, making your `.tf` files cleaner and easier to read and maintain.

---

### Q7: **What happens if you run `terraform apply` without running `terraform plan` first?**

**Answer:**
Terraform will internally create a plan and ask for your confirmation before applying changes. Running `plan` separately allows for better review and CI/CD workflows.

---

### Q8: **How can you skip manual approval during `terraform apply`?**

**Answer:**
Use the `-auto-approve` flag:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
