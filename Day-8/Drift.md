### 📘 **Terraform Drift Detection - Detailed Notes**

---

## 🔍 **What is Drift in Terraform?**

**Drift** refers to the situation where the **real infrastructure state differs from the Terraform state file**. This can happen when:

* Resources are **manually changed** outside of Terraform (e.g., via AWS Console).
* **Other automation tools** modify infrastructure.
* There are **automatic changes** done by cloud providers.

---

## ⚠️ **Why is Drift a Problem?**

* Causes **inconsistency** between the real environment and your IaC definition.
* May lead to **unexpected changes or errors** during Terraform `apply`.
* Undermines the purpose of **infrastructure as code** and **reproducibility**.

---

## 🛠️ **How to Detect Drift in Terraform**

### ✅ Using `terraform plan`

```bash
terraform plan
```

* Compares your current state file (`terraform.tfstate`) with the actual cloud resources.
* If any **drift** is detected, it will show a **diff** (e.g., "will be changed", "will be destroyed").
* However, `terraform plan` **doesn’t persist or highlight drift-only info** unless followed by `apply`.

---

### 🔎 Using `terraform apply`

```bash
terraform apply
```

* Also detects and corrects drift **by updating infrastructure** to match your configuration.
* Automatically applies detected drift if approved.

---

## 🧪 **Enhanced Drift Detection (Terraform Cloud/Enterprise)**

Terraform **Cloud and Enterprise** versions offer:

* **Drift Detection Alerts**:

  * Automatically checks for drift on a schedule (e.g., daily).
  * Sends notifications via email, Slack, etc.

* **Manual Drift Detection Triggers**:

  * From the UI, you can trigger drift detection.

> 🧠 Note: Drift detection in Terraform Cloud **does not change infrastructure**, it only alerts.

---

## 🧰 **Commands and Examples**

### 🗂️ Manual Drift Detection

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan.out
```

* See any changes due to drift before applying.

### 🧼 Correcting Drift

```bash
terraform apply tfplan.out
```

* Applies the changes necessary to reconcile the drift.

### 📂 Refresh the State

```bash
terraform refresh
```

* Updates the Terraform state file with the current real-world state **without making any changes** to the infrastructure.

## 📓 Example Scenario

### Example: S3 Bucket Versioning Drift

1. Terraform config defines:

```hcl
versioning {
  enabled = true
}
```

2. Someone disables versioning via AWS Console.
3. Run `terraform plan`, you'll see:

```diff
~ versioning {
- enabled = false
+ enabled = true
}
```

## 🧠 **Best Practices to Avoid Drift**

| Practice                    | Description                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Use CI/CD                   | Apply changes via pipeline to avoid manual edits. |
| Restrict Console Access     | Prevent unauthorized or manual changes.           |
| Enable Audit Logs           | Detect who/what changed resources.                |
| Monitor via Terraform Cloud | Use scheduled drift detection.                    |

## ❓ Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is drift in Terraform?

**A:** Drift is the difference between actual infrastructure and Terraform's state file caused by manual or external changes.

---

### Q2: How can you detect drift?

**A:** Use `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, or drift detection features in Terraform Cloud.

---

### Q3: Does Terraform automatically fix drift?

**A:** No, it **detects** it via `plan`. You must run `apply` to reconcile.

---

### Q4: What is the use of `terraform refresh`?

**A:** It updates the state file to reflect the current infrastructure **without applying any changes**.

---

### Q5: How can Terraform Cloud help with drift?

**A:** It can run scheduled drift detection and alert users when configuration drifts from reality.
