## ✅ Terraform: Locals, Expressions, Functions, Loops, Conditionals – Full Notes

---

### 🔹 1. **Locals – Local Variables**

#### 📘 What Are Locals?

`locals` are used to assign a name to a Terraform expression so you can reuse it multiple times.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```hcl
locals {
  instance_name = "web-server"
  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "demo"
  }
}
```

#### 📍 Usage:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags          = local.tags
}
```

#### 🔍 Benefits:

* Avoid redundancy
* Increase readability
* Easily manage complex expressions

---

### 🔹 2. **Terraform Expressions & Functions**

---

#### 📘 Terraform Expressions

Expressions allow you to compute or assign values dynamically.

Example:

```hcl
var.instance_count * 2
"Name-${var.environment}"
```

---

#### 📘 String Interpolation

String interpolation uses `${}` to embed variables or expressions in strings.

```hcl
"Hello, ${var.name}!"
"Instance Type: ${var.instance_type}"
```

From Terraform 0.12+, direct interpolation is often preferred:

```hcl
"Hello, " + var.name
```

#### 🔧 Common Built-in Functions:

| Function     | Description                            | Example                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `length()`   | Returns the length of a list or string | `length(var.list_of_ids)`          |
| `join()`     | Joins elements of a list into a string | `join(",", ["a", "b", "c"])`       |
| `split()`    | Splits a string into a list            | `split(",", "a,b,c")`              |
| `lookup()`   | Looks up a key in a map                | `lookup(var.ami_ids, "us-east-1")` |
| `concat()`   | Concatenates two or more lists         | `concat(var.list1, var.list2)`     |
| `contains()` | Checks if list contains a value        | `contains(["a","b"], "a")`         |
| `replace()`  | Replaces substring in a string         | `replace("abc", "a", "z")`         |

### 🔹 3. **Conditionals and Loops**

---

### 🔸 a) **`count` Parameter**

Allows you to create multiple instances of a resource.

#### ✅ Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "web-${count.index}"
  }
}
```

---

### 🔸 b) **`for_each` Parameter**

Used to create multiple resources from a **map** or **set**.

#### ✅ Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "servers" {
  for_each      = var.instance_map
  ami           = each.value.ami
  instance_type = each.value.type
  tags = {
    Name = each.key
  }
}
```

---

### 🔸 c) **`for` Expressions**

Used for transforming lists/maps.

#### ✅ List Example:

```hcl
locals {
  names = ["dev", "stage", "prod"]
  upper_names = [for name in local.names : upper(name)]
}
```

#### ✅ Map Example:

```hcl
locals {
  envs = {
    dev  = "t2.micro"
    prod = "t2.large"
  }
  instance_types = {
    for k, v in local.envs : k => upper(v)
  }
}
```

---

### 🔸 d) **Conditionals (`if` expressions)**

#### ✅ Syntax:

```hcl
condition ? true_value : false_value
```

#### ✅ Example:

```hcl
instance_type = var.env == "prod" ? "t3.large" : "t2.micro"
```

## 🧠 Terraform Interview Questions – Locals, Loops, Functions

---

### Q1: **What are `locals` in Terraform?**

**Answer:**
Locals are named expressions that can be reused in a module to reduce repetition. Defined using the `locals {}` block and accessed using `local.<name>`.

---

### Q2: **What is the difference between `count` and `for_each` in Terraform?**

**Answer:**

* `count` works with numbers and creates N copies of a resource.
* `for_each` works with maps/sets and allows better control over resource uniqueness.

---

### Q3: **Give an example of string interpolation in Terraform.**

**Answer:**

```hcl
"Hello, ${var.username}"
```

It dynamically inserts the value of `var.username`.

---

### Q4: **What are some commonly used built-in functions in Terraform?**

**Answer:**

* `length()` – to get number of elements.
* `lookup()` – to fetch value by key in a map.
* `join()` – to combine elements into a string.
* `concat()` – to merge lists.
* `replace()` – to modify strings.

---

### Q5: **Explain the use of `for` expressions with an example.**

**Answer:**

```hcl
[for name in ["dev", "prod"] : upper(name)]
```

This converts each item in the list to uppercase.

---

### Q6: **How does Terraform handle conditionals?**

**Answer:**
Using ternary syntax:

```hcl
var.env == "prod" ? "t3.large" : "t2.micro"
```

This allows setting values based on conditions.

---

### Q7: **Can you use `count` and `for_each` together in one resource?**

**Answer:**
No, `count` and `for_each` are **mutually exclusive**. You must use only one per resource.

---

### Q8: **What is the advantage of using locals over variables?**

**Answer:**
Variables are used for input; `locals` are internal, reusable expressions to simplify complex logic.
