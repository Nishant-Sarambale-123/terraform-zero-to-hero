Here are **detailed notes** on **🔄 Terraform Lifecycle Management**, covering each lifecycle rule: `create_before_destroy`, `prevent_destroy`, and `ignore_changes` — with **real-world examples**, **use cases**, and **interview scenario questions**.

---

## 🔄 **Terraform Lifecycle Management**

Terraform provides a `lifecycle` block inside a `resource` block to control **how resources are created, updated, or destroyed**.

---

### ✅ **1. `create_before_destroy`**

**Purpose:**
Ensures **new resource is created before the old one is destroyed**.

**Why?**
To **avoid downtime** in cases where Terraform would normally destroy and then create the resource (default behavior).

---

#### 📌 Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

**Use Case:**
Changing immutable attributes like:

* VPC ID in a `subnet`
* EBS volume type
* IAM role on some resources

---

#### 💡 Without `create_before_destroy`:

Terraform will **destroy first**, then **create**, causing **downtime**.

---

#### ⚠️ Caveat:

You must avoid name conflicts. For example, if the resource uses a fixed name like `name = "web-server"`, both old and new cannot coexist → will fail.

---

### ✅ **2. `prevent_destroy`**

**Purpose:**
Prevents accidental deletion of critical resources.

---

#### 📌 Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "prod_data" {
  bucket = "prod-data-bucket"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

**Use Case:**

* S3 buckets with production data
* IAM roles/policies
* Database instances (RDS)
* Secrets Manager resources

---

#### 💣 If you run `terraform destroy` or delete the resource from code:

You will get this error:

```
Error: Instance cannot be destroyed
```

✅ To override this, you need to **remove** the `prevent_destroy` block manually and re-apply.

---

### ✅ **3. `ignore_changes`**

**Purpose:**
Tells Terraform to **ignore specific attributes** even if they drift/change outside Terraform.

---

#### 📌 Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Environment = "prod"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      tags["Environment"]
    ]
  }
}
```

---

**Use Cases:**

* When certain attributes are managed **externally** (e.g., by users, scripts, or another tool).
* Ignore `user_data`, `tags`, `desired_capacity`, etc., which may change outside of Terraform.

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Rule                    | Description                            | Use Case Example                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `create_before_destroy` | Ensures new resource is created first  | Replace VPC, subnet, EC2 with zero downtime |
| `prevent_destroy`       | Blocks deletion of resource            | Protect S3, RDS, IAM policies               |
| `ignore_changes`        | Ignores updates to specific attributes | Ignore tag changes, user-managed fields     |

## 🎯 Interview Questions & Scenarios

---

### 🔸 **Q1: What is the difference between `create_before_destroy` and the default behavior of Terraform?**

**Answer:**
By default, Terraform destroys a resource before creating a new one (causing downtime). `create_before_destroy` ensures that a new resource is created first, then the old one is destroyed, avoiding downtime.

---

### 🔸 **Q2: You deleted an EC2 instance from the `.tf` file. What can you do to prevent Terraform from destroying it?**

**Answer:**
Add a `prevent_destroy` lifecycle rule to that resource.

---

### 🔸 **Q3: You changed tags manually on an EC2 instance in AWS Console, but don’t want Terraform to override them. How?**

**Answer:**
Use the `ignore_changes` lifecycle block for that specific tag or attribute.

---

### 🔸 **Q4: You have a fixed-named resource (`name = "prod-vm"`). What issue might occur if `create_before_destroy` is enabled?**

**Answer:**
Terraform will try to create a new resource with the same name before destroying the old one, which causes a **naming conflict** — deployment fails.

---

### 🔸 **Q5: How can you handle changes outside Terraform without letting it override them?**

**Answer:**
Use `ignore_changes` to let Terraform ignore the drifted values.

---

### 🔸 **Q6: Can `create_before_destroy` and `prevent_destroy` be used together?**

**Answer:**
Yes, but they serve different purposes:

* `create_before_destroy`: Enables safer resource replacement.
* `prevent_destroy`: Blocks deletion entirely (unless explicitly removed).

---

## ✅ Pro Tips:

* Always use `prevent_destroy` for **critical infrastructure.**
* Use `ignore_changes` carefully to **avoid configuration drift.**
* Use `create_before_destroy` when **zero-downtime replacements** are required, especially with load balancers, EC2 instances, and EBS volumes.
