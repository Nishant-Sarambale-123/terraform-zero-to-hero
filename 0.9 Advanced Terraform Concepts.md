Here are **detailed notes** on **Advanced Terraform Concepts**, covering:

* 🔧 Provisioners (`local-exec`, `remote-exec`)
* ⚙️ Meta-arguments (`depends_on`, `provider`, `lifecycle`)
* 🔌 Custom Providers
* 🔁 Dynamic Blocks

With **explanations, examples, best practices, and interview questions.**

## 🔧 **Provisioners**

Provisioners are used to **execute scripts or commands** on a local or remote machine after a resource is created or destroyed.

⚠️ **Use with caution** – they are **not idempotent** and **should be avoided** in most cases (Terraform may not track success/failure reliably).

---

### ✅ `local-exec` Provisioner

Runs a **command on the machine where Terraform is executed**.

#### 📌 Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Instance created: ${self.public_ip} >> instance.log"
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ `remote-exec` Provisioner

Runs a **command on the created resource itself** (via SSH or WinRM).

#### 📌 Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ec2-user"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt update",
      "sudo apt install -y nginx"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### 🚫 Best Practices:

* Avoid provisioners when possible; prefer cloud-init, userdata, or configuration tools (Ansible, Chef).
* They're only run during **initial creation** unless forced with `taint`.

---

## ⚙️ **Meta-Arguments**

Meta-arguments control **resource behavior and relationships**.

---

### ✅ `depends_on`

Forces explicit **dependency** between resources.

#### 📌 Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on = [aws_security_group.web_sg]
}
```

Terraform usually handles dependencies automatically, but `depends_on` is needed when:

* Using `for_each` or `count` with indirect references
* Working with modules that have no direct link

---

### ✅ `provider` Override

Allows you to **use multiple provider configurations**, e.g., deploying to multiple regions/accounts.

#### 📌 Example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "west" {
  provider = aws.us_west
  ami      = "ami-xyz"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

### ✅ `lifecycle`

Controls **resource creation/destruction/update behavior**.
See earlier section for details.

---

## 🔌 **Custom Providers (Advanced)**

Terraform supports writing your own **provider plugin** if you need to interact with an unsupported service or API.

---

### Steps to Create a Custom Provider:

1. Use **Go** language and [Terraform Plugin SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk).
2. Define:

   * `provider.go`
   * `resource_*.go` files
3. Implement CRUD functions: `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`.
4. Compile it as a binary.
5. Use in Terraform with `terraform {
     required_providers {
    custom = {
      source = "example.com/org/custom"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
     }
   }`

---

### ⚠️ When to Use:

* Proprietary internal APIs
* Non-cloud services like SaaS platforms
* Custom database automation, etc.

---

## 🔁 **Dynamic Blocks**

Used to **generate nested blocks dynamically** based on input variables or lists.

---

### ✅ Example: Dynamic `ingress` rules in Security Group

```hcl
variable "ports" {
  default = [22, 80, 443]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name = "web-sg"

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.ports
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value
      to_port     = ingress.value
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 🔍 Use Cases:

* Repeatable nested configs like:

  * `ingress/egress` rules
  * `container` blocks in ECS tasks
  * `volume_mounts` in Kubernetes resources

---

## 🎯 Interview Questions

### 🔸 **Q1: When should you use provisioners in Terraform?**

**Answer:** Only as a last resort when configuration cannot be managed by cloud-init or external tools. They're not idempotent and can lead to drift.

---

### 🔸 **Q2: What is the difference between `local-exec` and `remote-exec`?**

**Answer:**

* `local-exec`: Runs on your local machine (where Terraform runs)
* `remote-exec`: Runs on the created resource (via SSH/WinRM)

---

### 🔸 **Q3: How does `depends_on` help with Terraform's dependency graph?**

**Answer:** It forces Terraform to wait until a specific resource is fully created before another resource can be provisioned, overriding the automatic dependency detection.

---

### 🔸 **Q4: Why would you use `provider` override?**

**Answer:** To deploy resources across multiple regions/accounts by creating multiple aliases for the provider.

---

### 🔸 **Q5: What is a dynamic block in Terraform, and why is it useful?**

**Answer:**
Dynamic blocks allow you to **dynamically generate repeated nested configuration blocks**, reducing code duplication and improving flexibility based on variable inputs.

---

### 🔸 **Q6: What are the key components of building a custom Terraform provider?**

**Answer:**

* Written in Go using the Terraform Plugin SDK
* Implements CRUD operations
* Registers schema and resources
* Packaged as a plugin for Terraform to consume
