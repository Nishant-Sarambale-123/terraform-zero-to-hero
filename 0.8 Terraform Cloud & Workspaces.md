### 🔹 Terraform Cloud (TFC)

#### 📘 What is Terraform Cloud?

Terraform Cloud is a **SaaS (Software as a Service)** platform by **HashiCorp** designed for managing Terraform infrastructure in a **collaborative, secure, and scalable** way.

---

### ✅ Features of Terraform Cloud:

| Feature                         | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Remote Execution**            | Terraform plans and applies run in the cloud, not on your local machine. |
| **Version Control Integration** | Connects with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket to auto-trigger plans.           |
| **State Management**            | Stores Terraform state securely in the cloud.                            |
| **Collaborative Runs**          | Enables team collaboration and approval workflows.                       |
| **Variable Management**         | Manage environment and Terraform variables via UI/API.                   |
| **Sentinel Policies**           | Apply policies as code to enforce security, compliance, cost controls.   |
| **Notifications**               | Slack/email notifications for run status.                                |

### 💡 Benefits of Terraform Cloud:

* Secure storage of state and secrets
* Centralized collaboration
* Audit logging and role-based access
* No need to configure remote backends manually

---

### 🔧 Terraform Cloud Workflow:

1. Push code to VCS (GitHub, GitLab)
2. Terraform Cloud auto-runs `terraform plan`
3. Team reviews and approves
4. TFC applies the changes if approved

---

### 🔗 Terraform Cloud Dashboard:

Provides visual access to:

* Current & historical runs
* Workspaces
* Variables
* Policies (Sentinel)

---

## 🔹 Terraform Workspaces

---

### 📘 What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is a **logical instance** of a Terraform state. It allows you to manage **multiple environments** (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) using the **same configuration**.

By default, Terraform creates a workspace named `default`.

---

### ✅ Use Cases for Workspaces:

* Separate state files for different environments
* Avoid code duplication for multi-env deployment
* Manage state isolation

---

### 🔧 CLI Commands for Workspaces:

| Command                       | Description                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `terraform workspace list`    | Lists all workspaces                |
| `terraform workspace new dev` | Creates a new workspace named `dev` |
| `terraform workspace select`  | Switches to an existing workspace   |
| `terraform workspace show`    | Shows the current active workspace  |
| `terraform workspace delete`  | Deletes a workspace                 |

---

### 📦 Example:

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply
```

Each workspace has its **own `terraform.tfstate` file**.

---

### ⚠️ Workspace ≠ Full Environment Isolation

* Workspaces separate state, not configuration.
* You may still need conditionals (e.g., `var.environment`) to change behavior based on workspace.

---

### 📝 Recommended Practice:

Use workspaces for **simple environment separation**.
Use **separate configurations/repos** for more complex use cases.

## 🧠 Terraform Cloud & Workspaces – Interview Questions

---

### 🔸 **Q1. What is Terraform Cloud? Why would you use it?**

**Answer:**
Terraform Cloud is a SaaS platform by HashiCorp for managing Terraform workflows. It allows remote execution, team collaboration, secure state storage, and policy enforcement. It's preferred for team-based or enterprise deployments.

---

### 🔸 **Q2. What is the difference between local state and Terraform Cloud?**

**Answer:**

* Local state is stored in `terraform.tfstate` on your machine.
* Terraform Cloud stores state remotely, securely, and supports collaboration, locking, and history tracking.

---

### 🔸 **Q3. What are workspaces in Terraform?**

**Answer:**
Workspaces are isolated instances of state. You can use them to manage multiple environments (like dev, test, prod) with the same configuration.

---

### 🔸 **Q4. How do you create and switch between workspaces?**

**Answer:**

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
```

---

### 🔸 **Q5. What happens when you run `terraform apply` in a different workspace?**

**Answer:**
Terraform uses a separate state for each workspace. So, changes in the `dev` workspace won’t affect the `prod` environment.

---

### 🔸 **Q6. Can Terraform Cloud run plans automatically? How?**

**Answer:**
Yes. If connected to a VCS like GitHub, Terraform Cloud can auto-trigger `terraform plan` when changes are pushed.

---

### 🔸 **Q7. What is Sentinel in Terraform Cloud?**

**Answer:**
Sentinel is a policy-as-code framework in Terraform Cloud that enforces rules like:

* Preventing certain resources
* Enforcing tag standards
* Limiting instance types

---

## 🧩 Terraform Cloud & Workspaces – Scenario-Based Questions

---

### 🧩 **Scenario 1:**

**Your team needs to manage multiple environments (dev, stage, prod) using the same Terraform code. What's the best approach?**

**Answer:**
Use **Terraform workspaces**:

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new stage
terraform workspace new prod
```

Use conditional logic in variables to differentiate behavior:

```hcl
instance_type = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "t3.large" : "t2.micro"
```

---

### 🧩 **Scenario 2:**

**You're working in Terraform Cloud and want all `prod` deployments to be reviewed by a senior engineer. How can you achieve this?**

**Answer:**
Use **Terraform Cloud run approvals** with Sentinel policies:

* Define policy to block automatic `apply` in `prod`
* Require manual approval from a designated user or team

---

### 🧩 **Scenario 3:**

**Two engineers run `terraform apply` at the same time in Terraform Cloud. Will it cause conflict?**

**Answer:**
No, Terraform Cloud automatically locks the state. Only one operation can proceed; others are queued until the lock is released.

---

### 🧩 **Scenario 4:**

**Your organization wants to enforce a rule: “No AWS instance should be of type larger than `t3.medium`.” How can this be done?**

**Answer:**
Use **Sentinel policy enforcement** in Terraform Cloud to write a rule that blocks provisioning of larger instance types.

---

### 🧩 **Scenario 5:**

**You want developers to manage `dev` infrastructure but restrict `prod` access. How do you set this up in Terraform Cloud?**

**Answer:**
Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** in Terraform Cloud:

* Assign developers to the `dev` workspace with write access
* Give `prod` access only to admins
